          <p class="text-center subbodycontent hiphentxt pt-0">In this rapidly evolving global educational landscape, schools are
            starting to be seen as a heavy expense, we aim at helping save the schools to safeguard the interests and
            future of our nation. There are rising new resources required and rising demands for each school and we
            ensure that we provide them with everything they need to achieve all their goals!</p>
          <p class="text-center subbodycontent hiphentxt pt-0">A large portion of schools finds it difficult to achieve their set goals
            and statistics show that this is primarily due to a mere formal assessment practice that we have in place
            today. Other than inadequate assessments, there could also be a variety of reasons for schools to fail their
            targets and goals. With our help, schools can identify, pinpoint, and resolve each hurdle to ensure that
            they reach all set targets with ease.</p>

                <p>While teaching can be inclusive, Learning is exclusive. Learning varies from student to student based
                  on so many factors that influence the learning of every individual.
                  ZingLEES (Zing Learner Evaluation & Empowerment Solutions), is an emerging exclusive evaluation
                  enterprise for the K-12 segment.
                </p>
                <p>Understanding the understanding of every student is the first key step to ensure learning for every
                  child in every class. We at ZingLEES by associating with schools as evaluation partners, through our
                  purposeful and mindful evaluation process will help schools and teachers have detailed insights of the
                  student’s strengths, needs, weakness, struggle patterns, understanding levels in every subject in
                  every concept.</p>
                <p>Understanding the limitations of the schools and the teachers and break away from the monotonous
                  assessment formality which focuses on testing just the rote memory and to support the schools,
                  ZingLEES’s services will squarely meet the expectations set by NEP 2020 in assessing the learning of
                  every child. This will also help the schools in scoring better grades in the SEQI assessment for
                  schools.</p>

            The primary goal of each parent is to ensure that their children are equipped with the necessary skills to
            be able to conquer any future challenges and hurdles with ease. However, when it comes to monitoring their
            child’s education, they leave it solely up to the schools to ensure that their children are successful.
            Parents depend on test results and notifications from the schools as key identifiers about their child’s
            performance.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left whyus-bi1 hiphentxt py-0">
            The current reports about the performance do not give proper insight into the strengths, needs, weaknesses,
            and problem areas of the child. Thus parents are not able to intervene when their child needs them the most.
